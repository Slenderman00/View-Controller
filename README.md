# View-Controller
A really basic view controller for PHP

    "tags" can be added to views by surounding the tag name with -> {{}}
    the view is selected by calling the view function feks view("views/home.html")
    tag information is changed by calling the tag function feks tag(tag name, data)
    result can be returned at the end of the php script by calling the returnView function
